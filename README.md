# PyWhiteboard

PyWhiteboard is a Python-based application that enables you to use your hand gestures to draw and create art on a virtual whiteboard.

## Usage
- Draw with your index finger
- Select button with both index and middle finger
- Clear canvas when only middle finger is up

## Features
- Hand gesture recognition: Tracks your hand movements in real-time using computer vision techniques and recognizes gestures for drawing on the whiteboard.
- Multi-color drawing: Offers a variety of colors to choose from for drawing on the canvas, including red, blue, green, yellow, and an eraser option.
- Adjustable brush size: Allows you to adjust the brush size based on the position of your finger, providing control over the thickness of your drawings.
- Clear canvas option: Provides a clear canvas button to reset the whiteboard and start fresh.
- Real-time drawing visualization: Displays your drawings and hand movements in real-time, creating an interactive and engaging drawing experience.

## Week 1: Project Setup and Basic Functionality
### Objective: Set up the project structure and environment for PyWhiteboard.

- Create a new Python project and set up a virtual environment.
- Initialize a Git repository and connect it to a remote repository on GitHub.
- Install the necessary dependencies, including OpenCV, Mediapipe, and any other required libraries.

### Objective: Implement the basic functionality of PyWhiteboard.

- Set up the main script or entry point for the application.
- Initialize the camera or video feed for real-time hand tracking.
- Implement hand tracking using computer vision techniques and the Mediapipe library.
- Enable gesture recognition for drawing on the whiteboard.
- Display the canvas and the user's hand movements in real-time.

## Week 2: Enhancing Drawing Features and User Interaction
### Objective: Improve drawing functionality.

- Implement multi-color drawing by allowing the user to select different colors for drawing on the canvas.
- Create color selection boxes and map each box to a specific color.
- Update the drawing logic to utilize the selected color when tracking hand movements.

### Objective: Implement brush size adjustment.

- Add a pen size bar or slider to the user interface.
- Allow the user to adjust the brush size based on the position of their finger along the pen size bar/slider.
- Update the drawing logic to use the adjusted brush size for the drawings.

### Objective: Enhance user interaction.

- Implement a clear canvas button to reset the whiteboard and remove all drawings.
- Handle user input or gestures for interacting with the clear canvas button.
- Provide visual feedback or confirmation to the user when the canvas is cleared.

## Week 3: Refinement and Testing
### Objective: Refine the user interface and overall experience.

- Improve the visual appearance of the user interface, including color boxes, pen size bar, and clear canvas button.
- Optimize the layout and placement of UI elements for better usability.
- Incorporate user feedback and make necessary adjustments to enhance the overall user experience.

### Objective: Perform thorough testing and debugging.

- Test the application with various hand movements and gestures to ensure accurate tracking and drawing functionality.
- Identify and fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
- Optimize the codebase for performance and efficiency.

### Objective: Documentation and Finalization

- Update the README file with comprehensive project documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and any additional information.
- Review and revise the project documentation for clarity and completeness.
- Perform a final code review, clean up any redundant or unused code, and ensure proper code formatting and commenting.
- Prepare the project for deployment and create a release version.
