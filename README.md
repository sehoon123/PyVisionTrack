# PyVisionTrack

PyVisionTrack is a Python-based object tracking project that utilizes OpenCV to enable real-time object tracking in videos or camera feeds. This project provides a flexible and intuitive framework for developers to track objects with ease.

## Features

- Multiple tracking algorithms: PyVisionTrack offers a variety of tracking algorithms, including (but not limited to) KCF, MOSSE, and CSRT. Choose the algorithm that best suits your tracking requirements.
- Real-time object tracking: Track objects in real-time from video files or live camera feeds.
- Customizable parameters: Fine-tune tracking parameters such as the tracking window size, padding, and more, to achieve optimal tracking performance.
- Object detection and initialization: Utilize object detection techniques (e.g., Haar cascades, deep learning-based detectors) to detect and initialize object tracking.
- Multiple object tracking: Track multiple objects simultaneously, each with its own tracking algorithm and parameters.
- Interactive graphical interface: PyVisionTrack provides an optional graphical interface for interactive object selection and visualization.

## Week 1: Project Setup and Basic Functionality
### Objective: Set up the project structure and environment for PyVisionTrack.

- Create a new Python project and set up a virtual environment.
- Initialize a Git repository and connect it to a remote repository on GitHub.
- Install the necessary dependencies, including OpenCV and any other required libraries.

### Objective: Implement the basic functionality of object tracking.

- Set up the main script or entry point for the application.
- Load video files or connect to the camera feed for real-time tracking.
- Implement a simple tracking algorithm (e.g., KCF) to track a single object.
- Display the tracked object or bounding box on the video feed.

## Week 2: Advanced Tracking Algorithms and Customization
### Objective: Integrate additional tracking algorithms.

- Research and select other tracking algorithms supported by OpenCV (e.g., MOSSE, CSRT).
- Implement multiple tracking algorithms and provide the option to choose between them.
- Evaluate the performance and accuracy of each algorithm and document the findings.

### Objective: Implement object detection and initialization.

- Explore object detection techniques (e.g., Haar cascades, deep learning-based detectors) and choose one to integrate.
- Implement object detection to automatically initialize the object tracking process.
- Fine-tune the object detection parameters to improve accuracy and robustness.

### Objective: Allow customization of tracking parameters.

- Implement a configuration system that allows users to adjust tracking parameters (e.g., window size, padding).
- Provide an interface or command-line options to customize these parameters.

## Week 3: User Interface and Refinement
### Objective: Develop an interactive graphical interface (optional).

- Design and implement a user-friendly graphical interface for PyVisionTrack.
- Enable object selection by clicking or drawing bounding boxes on the video feed.
- Integrate controls to switch between tracking algorithms and adjust parameters.

### Objective: Refine the project and conduct testing.

- Perform extensive testing and debugging to ensure the stability and reliability of PyVisionTrack.
- Optimize the codebase for efficiency and performance.
- Conduct thorough documentation of the project, including a README file and inline code comments.

### Objective: Finalize the project and prepare for deployment.

- Review the project code, clean up any redundant or unused code.
- Update the README file with comprehensive project documentation, including installation instructions and usage examples.
- Ensure all licensing and attribution requirements are met.
- Create a release version and prepare for deployment.
